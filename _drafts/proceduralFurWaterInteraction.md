In August 2016, I presented a masterclass at my alma mater Bournemouth University on Advanced Procedural
techniques in Houdini.
In this post, I will try to condense the contents of the class into shorter easy to understand concepts
which might help others venturing into proceduralism using [SideFx's Houdini](https://sidefx.com).

Overview
-------

FX as a discipline is very diverse an dunlike other disciplines there are no fixed problem sets.
It is usually treated as a catch all umbrella term for a lot of technical or unconventional work.

Motivation
-------
- Art-directable
- Extensibility
- Reusability
- Modularity
