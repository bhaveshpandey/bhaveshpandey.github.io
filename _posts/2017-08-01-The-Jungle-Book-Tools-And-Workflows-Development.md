title: The Jungle Book - Tools and Workflows Development.
subtitle: Realistic Procedural Fur-Water Interaction.
---

Here's a collection of my my work on Disney's The Jungle Book.

- Most of my work on the show involved developing entire suite of Fur tools
in Houdini for realistic and Procedural Fur - Water interaction.

- Developing Force occlusion models which create realistic occlusion details for
simulations. These were used extensively across the creature fx shots to achieve
self-occlusion effects for fur on characters.

- Developing wind models equipped with these occlusion models.

- Developing wire solver tools which could then be used by the Creature FX team in Maya
via Houdini Engine.

- In addition, I was also responsible for developing and wrapping houdini digital assets
which could then be used in Maya via Houdini Engine.

- Setting up Katana template scenes for quick render tests and approvals.

**NOTE:** Some of the shots presented above have been run by other artists in my team using the tools/workflows
developed by myself (specially the shots which are not from the Bare Necessities sequence).
