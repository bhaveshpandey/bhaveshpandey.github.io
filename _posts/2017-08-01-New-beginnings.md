Few months ago, I came across [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and decided to test it out on my webpage.
Being a super lazy, I never really worked on my webpage other than some fun testing with Jekyll.
So I decided to cancel my previous web hosting account which would wake me out of the slumber.

Now my previous webpage is offline and I am forced to work on my page over the weekend and push it online!

In due time, I will pull in the posts from my old blog to this website as my old website was linked to the blog.
Until then, here's the link to the [Old Blog](https://bhaveshpandey.blogspot.com).

Here's to new beginnings.
