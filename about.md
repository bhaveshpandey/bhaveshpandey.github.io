Hi I am Bhavesh, a Visual Effects Technical Director based in London and currently working with [Industrial Light and Magic](http://ilm.com).

I enjoy problem solving and developing tools to address VFX requirements efficiently while also offering higher degree of control over art direction of the effects.
While the end goal of Visual Effects is the visual aesthetic of final images, technical detail and elegance is equally important to me.

This webpage will host my VFX related work/content and also my exploits into Computer Vision, Machine Learning and
development work in visual effects.

If you want to get in touch for any consulting work, please leave me a message on the [Contact](https://bhaveshpandey.github.io/contact) page.
